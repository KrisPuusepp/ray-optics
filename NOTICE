Modifications in this fork include:
- a lot of UI now being hidden, preventing actions such as adding new objects
- direct movement of objects being prevented (handles must be used)
- some rendering code having been commented out to simplify the view of the objects in the simulation
- changes to simulation loading and URL handling
- a new impartial EE locale
